This project was originally created by me as a tool to bypass organizational restrictions on locked-down school computers by enabling remote access control.  (Shoutout to my schools IT teacher for allowing me to make stuff like this instead of studying for my exams)

Over time, it developed further as a side project, evolving into a low-level experimental malware framework.
